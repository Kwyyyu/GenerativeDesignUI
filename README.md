# GenerativeDesignUI

As an innovative iterative design process that integrates algorithms to optimize the outcome, generative design has been
gaining attention over the past couple of years in the designer field, especially when it comes to mechanical design and
engineering. With the majority of generative design software in the area of the conventional design environment, the need of
implementing generative design processes in the immersive environment, especially augmented reality (AR), is rapidly increasing.
  
Our project is to develop the user interface for generative design software in AR to help designers interact with the software
graphically. With this user interface, designers can view the outcome of their design regarding the constraints and requirements
in a more visualizing and feed-forwarding manner.
